**→ ~ [Reboot your Mac](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b9df1b8720134d38a52103f5f56bd03c)** 💻

A very simple Shortcut to reboot your Mac with a keyboard shortcut (^+⌥+R in my case)

---

**→ ~ [Shutdown your Mac](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7d2ff3708c374747b516f896ec115fc3)** 💻

A very simple Shortcut to shutdown your Mac with a keyboard shortcut (^+⌥+Q in my case)

**→ ~ [Rates including VAT](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d3b833680c6d4c649a6fade39f3397e9)** 📱 💻

This shortcut simply allows you to calculate tax including rates from a tax free rate.At the first launch, you will be asked to specify the tax rate applied in your country.You can place this shortcut as a widget on the home screen or on the left page of your iPhone/iPad or in the menu bar of macOS :)

NB: <em>I used a little workaround to avoid a bug in Shortcuts app on iOS/iPadOS: if a comma (,) is entered in the "Rate without taxes" field via the numeric keypad: Shortcuts will return an error. The "Calculate expression" command actually expects a dot (.)</em>

**→ ~ [Add to my wishlist](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/aef4e276587a48668e1e7521836e863c)** 📱 💻

With the arrival of iOS 11, a very useful feature has disappeared: the apps wishlist.
It allowed you to save apps to be able to download them later (I used it a lot to save games to get them on my iPad, I refuse to install games on my iPhone. Also useful to wait until finances are better to acquire a paid app for example).
In short, I've been looking for a replacement in third-party apps but never found a perfect solution.
It is of course possible to record this in a note or in a reminders list via the share sheet but the problem is that most of the informations are missing.
Again: Shortcut is a very elegant solution to do exactly what you want.
This shortcut allows you to save all the necessary details of an app (name, weight, price, in-app purchase, link) in a reminder list of your choice.

**→ ~ [MastoNewsWire](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3d0d0cfeff144c2d8c24583603d10c52)** 📱

Since Twitter decided to make its various APIs unusable, we have seen the death of many of the social network's clients. But some other apps are also losing features; it's the case of NetNewsWire (which I strongly invite you to try if you don't know it yet!).
Indeed, until last month, this excellent RSS reader allowed you to "follow" Twitter users to get their different posts with your other news. I use it for example to follow developers whose site is not RSS compatible.
As I'm less and less on the blue bird because of its stench since its takeover, I decided to do the same thing with the Mastodon accounts of my favorite developers!
Well, it's quite simple: you just have to copy the URL of the account as @domain.social/@user and add the extension ".rss" after it.
Something that it is therefore quite simple to do with Shortcuts 🥰.
So here it is.
Just tap the share icon in Safari or in your favorite Mastodon client then tap "MastoNewsWire".

**→ ~ [ShortGPT](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/498df0617da247eb955247765489f495)** 📱 💻

**Have a conversation with ChatGPT!**

This shortcut allows you to ask questions to ChatGPT as you would with Siri... but in different!

**→ ~ [whats.my.ip](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bbbad575627e4c75a2821efac4f19580)** 📱 💻

**A shortcut that allows you to get and copy your different IP addresses**

Whether I'm configuring my home network, setting up my (reverse-)proxy or opening certain ports on my Internet box, I often need to know the local IP or external IP assigned to me.‌‌If you have to do this kind of thing you will be happy to know that Shortcuts allows you to get this information quickly (without having to go to the Settings or the Internet).‌‌This shortcut displays your different IP addresses (local and external, IPv4 and IPv6).‌‌

A tap or a click on one of the results will copy the item to the clipboard ;)

NB: <em>A bug on older versions of iOS/iPadOS and macOS prevents Shortcuts from getting the external IPv6.‌
A workaround for these versions has been found: use the API of https//ip6.me.</em>

**→ ~ [Save an app icon from the App Store](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8302c5a904f14def91317c8c378df6aa)** 📱 💻

**A shortcut that allows you to save an app icon from the App Store**

The purpose of this shortcut is to allow you, directly from Shortcuts, to search for an app by its name and to save its icon in your photo library. [works both on iOS, iPadOS and macOS]
It's that simple!
